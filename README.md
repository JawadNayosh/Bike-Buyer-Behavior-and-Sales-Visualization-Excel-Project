# Bike Buyer Behavior and Sales Visualization

## Project Summary
The project involves analyzing a bike company's sales data to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior and demographics. The data has been cleaned, processed, and visualized in the form of a dashboard. This dashboard helps stakeholders understand key trends, such as the influence of income, age, and commute distance on bike purchases. It also considers other factors like marital status, region, and education.

##Step-by-step explanation

###1. Data Collection
Gathered raw data from sales report, containing information such as customer demographics, income, commute distances, and bike purchase behavior.

###2. Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates, inconsistencies, or missing values to ensure data quality.
Reformatted data (e.g., converting text to proper cases or standardizing numerical formats).
Verified that all fields (e.g., income, education, etc.) had consistent and accurate values.

###3. Data Processing and Transformation
Grouped data into meaningful categories, such as age ranges (young, middle-aged, older) or commute distances.
Created calculated fields (e.g., average income) to enable deeper insights.

###4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted initial analysis to identify trends, correlations, and patterns (e.g., how gender or commute distance influences bike purchases).
Used statistical measures such as averages, counts, and distributions to summarize the data.

###5. Pivot Table Creation
Built pivot tables to summarize data dynamically, aggregating it by fields like income, gender, or purchase status.
Enabled quick slicing and dicing of data for deeper analysis.

###6. Visualization Design
Designed charts and graphs to communicate insights clearly:
Bar charts for comparing average income across genders.
Line charts for analyzing trends like commute distances.

###7. Dashboard Creation
Combined key visualizations into a unified, interactive dashboard using slicers for filtering by categories (e.g., marital status, region, education).
Ensured the dashboard was user-friendly and visually appealing for stakeholders.

###What the Dashboard Tells About the Company
Customer Demographics: Middle-aged customers and those with shorter commute distances are the primary target audience for bike purchases.

Income Impact: Customers with higher incomes are more likely to purchase bikes, with a noticeable difference for female buyers.

Potential Segmentation Opportunities:
Region and education filters could reveal additional trends.
Marital status may have a slight impact on purchasing decisions and can help refine marketing efforts.
